# To Run Database

localhost:8080/showall (to view all userdata api)
localhost:8080/deleteall (to delete all of the user data)

// Used MySQL for database
// We can store the user data in the database in the machine (Local ony though)
// Apart for machine, I'm really doubt that database can be run (I'll try to use only server)
